A python script to rename more than one files in a directory.

Usage : python rename.py <path> <new_name.extension>

This script renames the files present in the directory given by <path> and places the renamed files in a directory called "pic_folder" that will be created within <path>.

Example : Python rename.py /home/haris/pictures/tour/ tour.jpg

Output : tour1.jpg, tour2.jpg, etc.

FIXME
-----

I could not find a way to rename the files by keeping it within the existing directory itself. That is why I'm creating a new folder and moving the files to there. I'm working on it.

Thank you!
